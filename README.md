# Data_Mining_4_Regression_Modeling

This repository contains an R Markdown assignment report that explores linear regression models, model fit, and prediction errors using a structured dataset. The objective was to build interpretable regression models, evaluate their performance, and reflect on model complexity and residual analysis.

### üß© Business Problem

Understanding the relationship between input variables and a continuous outcome is a foundational task in many domains, from economics to marketing to engineering. Regression models provide a way to predict numeric responses, explain key relationships, and assess model assumptions.

This assignment focused on creating a linear regression model to predict a continuous variable using both **main effects** and **interaction terms**, while exploring the implications of model complexity, diagnostics, and residual behavior.

### üéØ Project Objective

The primary goals of this assignment were:

- To fit and interpret multiple linear regression models using the `lm()` function in R
- To explore model diagnostics such as **residual plots** and **error metrics**
- To compare the performance of different models (main effects vs. interaction effects)
- To assess the implications of **overfitting** and **underfitting**
- To reflect on how increasing model complexity affects predictive accuracy

### üõ†Ô∏è Solution Approach

The assignment followed a thoughtful modeling process:

- **Data Preparation**:
  - Loaded and briefly inspected the dataset
  - Selected appropriate predictors based on the problem context
- **Model Building**:
  - Fit a main effects model using linear regression
  - Extended the model by including interaction terms
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Compared models using residual plots, R¬≤ values, and prediction error
  - Examined how predictions varied across different complexity levels
- **Visualization**:
  - Used base R and `ggplot2` to create diagnostic plots and compare model predictions

### üí° Business Value

While the assignment was academic, the methodology applies broadly in industry:

- **Forecasting**: Linear regression is foundational in sales prediction, cost modeling, and operational planning
- **Interpretability**: Coefficients provide insights into relationships between features and outcomes
- **Diagnostics**: Residuals and fit metrics guide model trustworthiness
- **Model Comparison**: Helps select the optimal balance between simplicity and predictive performance

### üöß Challenges Encountered

- **Interaction Effects**: Understanding how variables jointly affect the outcome required thoughtful interpretation
- **Multicollinearity**: Including interaction terms risked correlated predictors, affecting coefficient stability
- **Model Fit vs. Generalization**: Higher complexity reduced residual error but raised overfitting concerns
